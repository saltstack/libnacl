libnacl 2.1.0 Release Notes
===========================

Add Support for the Key Exchange System
=======================================

Added the libnacl.kx module. This module contains the ExchangeKey class.

The ExchangeKey class makes it easy to use AEAD encryption with an
exchange key setup. The class works much like a sealed box but allows
for the creation of the exchange keys.

This makes it very easy to set up a system using AEAD and exchange keys.

Fix issues with pyproject.toml
==============================

The 2.0.0 release introduced the use of poetry into libnacl, unfortunately I
made a mistake in the pyproject.toml file. Thanks for @mgorny for catching the
issue and getting a PR in.
