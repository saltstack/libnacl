Signing and Verifying Messages
==============================

The nacl libs have the capability to sign and verify messages.

To sign and verify messages use the Signer and Verifier classes:

.. code-block:: python

    import libnacl.sign

    msg = (b'Well, that\'s no ordinary rabbit.  That\'s the most foul, '
           b'cruel, and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on.')
    # Create a Signer Object, if the key seed value is not passed in the
    # signing keys will be automatically generated
    signer = libnacl.sign.Signer()
    # Sign the message, the signed string is the message itself plus the
    # signature
    signed = signer.sign(msg)
    # If only the signature is desired without the message:
    signature = signer.signature(msg)
    # To create a verifier pass in the verify key:
    veri = libnacl.sign.Verifier(signer.hex_vk())
    # Verify the message!
    verified = veri.verify(signed)
    verified2 = veri.verify(signature + msg)

Saving Keys to Disk
===================

All libnacl key objects can be safely saved to disk via the save method. This
method changes the umask before saving the key file to ensure that the saved
file can only be read by the user creating it and cannot be written to.

.. code-block:: python

    import libnacl.sign

    signer = libnacl.sign.Signer()
    signer.save('/etc/nacl/signer.key')
